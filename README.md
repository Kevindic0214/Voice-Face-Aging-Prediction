# Voice-Face-Aging-Prediction

## 📝 Project Overview

**Voice-Face-Aging-Prediction** is an early-stage research project exploring how to predict healthy aging conditions using **voice** and **facial expression** data. The goal is to develop a multimodal machine learning framework that supports early screening and health assessment, especially in cognitive and emotional aging.

## 🧪 Objectives

- Analyze voice features that may reflect language and cognitive decline  
- Examine facial expression changes and emotional responses  
- Combine voice and facial data for multimodal aging prediction

## 🚧 Current Progress

- [ ] Data collection and annotation
- [ ] Feature extraction (voice + face)
- [ ] Model selection and initial experiments
- [ ] Evaluation metrics and experiment design
